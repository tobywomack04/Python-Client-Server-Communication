Client and server communication (Python)

Developed using Python.<br>
This project is a simple Python-based client-server application built using sockets. The server checks whether numbers sent by the client are powers of two and responds with either "true" or "false" accordingly.

How to operate:<br>
Run the server script (echo-server1.py) on one machine/terminal and run the client script (echo-client1.py) on another terminal/machine. Enter a series of numbers (max 4) when prompted by the client. The client will then send these numbers to the server. The server checks whether the numbers are powers of two and sends back the resulst. The client will then display the results.

Example:<br>
User enters: 1, 20, 8, 5 (on seperate lines).<br>
Client displays: true, false, true, false.
